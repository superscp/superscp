## Our Commitment
We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being respectful and constructive in feedback.
- Assuming good intent while discussing technical disagreements.
- Focusing critiques on ideas and implementation details, not people.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, hate speech, or discrimination.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or inflammatory comments.
- Publishing private information without explicit permission.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and may take appropriate action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is officially representing the project.

## Enforcement
Report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers by opening a private security report as described in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md), or by contacting the repository owner directly.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
